better documentation will come soon.
-----------------------------------------

all things happening in the game will be presented to you trough events. you can make a script and register it to as many events as you want.
to register to a event you need the following things in your script:

1.
	void OnEnable()
		
	{
		EventManager.StartListening("eventnamehere", SomeFunction);
		//add all events to listen to here
	}
	replace the eventnamehere with the name of the event you want to listen to.
	replace SomeFunction with the name of the function you want to be called when the event you just specified is activated.

2.
	void OnDisable()
	{
		EventManager.StopListening("eventnamehere", SomeFunction);
		//add all events to stop listening to here
	}
	replace the eventnamehere with the name of the event you want to stop listening to.
	replace SomeFunction with the name of the function that you want to stop being called when the event you just specified is activated.


3.
	void SomeFunction(GameObject g, float f)
	{
		//code for linked event goes here
	}


all functions required to change the gameplay/make stuff happen will be available trough the ScriptingInterface. you can call a function by doing this:
	
	void TriggersOnEnemyDeath(GameObject g, float f)
	{
		SI.SpawnPowerup();
	}

where the SI is the scripting interface. all functions will be static so you can just type SI (in capitals) anywhere to gain access to them.


Notes:
you can register multiple functions to the same event. this is also why you have to specify what function you want to stop in the stoplistening function.
make sure you make a stoplistening in the OnDisable for every StartListening you make in your scripts. not stopping the listeners causes memory leaks! (bart will check for a fix for this later)
every function that is called from a event NEEDS to have the GameObject and float parameters (the (GameObject g, float f) part) if you do not have this the function can not be called.
^ not every event will return an actual gameobject / float. always check the documentation to see if you should use the returned values.
not all functions are there yet. if you miss something tell a technical. if you miss multiple items, make a list out of what you want access to and give us the list when you ask us for the additions.

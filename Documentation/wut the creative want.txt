shit we need 
-------------------------------

1. Fix the bosses :
   -water boss take no damage and when it initially fires the projectile should go trought the arms or above
   -mole boss if we redirect once a projectile we cant redirect it again

2. DONE - We need a slider to change the amount of energy you lose when blob hits wall	

3. DONE - Bouncing of the blobs	

4. DONE - Limit of blobs/projectiles in each level, also make slider for this so we can change it if need it

5. DONE - When boss fight starts all blobs need to disapear or when they hit wall  you dont loose energy

6. DONE - When a fight with the boss ends somehow it starts tutorial and after that tutorial it goes to boss again, it should go to clean up

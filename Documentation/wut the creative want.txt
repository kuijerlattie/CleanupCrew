shit we need 
-------------------------------

1. Fix the bosses :
   -water boss take no damage and when it initially fires the projectile should go trought the arms or above
   -mole boss if we redirect once a projectile we cant redirect it again

2. We need a slider to change the amount of energy you lose when blob hits wall

3. Bouncing of the blobs 

4. Limit of blobs/projectiles in each level, also make slider for this so we can change it if need it

5. When boss fight starts all blobs need to disapear or when they hit wall  you dont loose energy

6. When a fight with the boss ends somehow it starts tutorial and after that tutorial it goes to boss again, it should go to clean up
